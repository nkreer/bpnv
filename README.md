# bpnv

"Barrierefreier Personennahverkehr" (bpnv) will be one of the few routing apps for the German public transportation network that puts user experience first. It will try to give as much information as possible while keeping irrelevant information in the background, so you can still access it when needed. It will be especially tuned to support the needs of nonvisual passengers by incorporating truly accessible directions and instructions to get around in unfamiliar locations in different formats, such as verbose text to speech Maps-like navigation or a clean user interface. Current public transit apps are often very hard to use and show data in a very visual way, and lack certain functionality that would be beneficial to the nonvisual users bpnv will cater towards. 

If you would like to help with this project, feel free to get in touch with me. I am currently still planning this out and would appreciate any feedback from potential users.

Yours truly,
a very dissappointed user of any of the available public transit apps.
