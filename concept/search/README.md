# search

Searching is mission-critical for this application as it is its primary usecase. Thus, it is important to make as much data as possible visible within the search results as power users will frequently decide their route by criteria such as changes at certain locations, vehicle type, train line, etc. However, most users prefer a clean interface and less data shown, so there should be massive amounts of configuration for this. Shown in this mockup is only a version with most information displayed to the user. 

On mobile, keep users' rapid scrolling behaviour in mind, so make sure the boxes displaying the connection details are always exactly the same size so they can get a feel for how long to scroll to specific elements.

## Thoughts and considerations

* Massive amounts of user-customisation about data shown in the search results
    * Default to show not much data at all
